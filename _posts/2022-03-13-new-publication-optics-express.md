excerpt: "New publication in journal [Optics Express](https://opg.optica.org/oe/home.cfm) about freeform optical design for optical assembly and its application to
robotic hand-eye calibration."

I am happy to anounce a new publication in the renowned [Optics Express](https://opg.optica.org/oe/home.cfm) journal (h-index 271). 
Its idea centers around the design of freeform lenses to improve optical assembly and its application to robotic hand-eye calibration.

Feel free to take a look at it [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.455188).
